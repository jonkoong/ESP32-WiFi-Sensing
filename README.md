# ESP32-WiFi-Sensing
This is a project about utilizing CSI data in wireless signals to apply machine learning methods in order to predict certain human activities in a give environment.
The project use the ESP32 microcontrollers as both TX and RX with the help of the ESP32 CSI tools for data collection as well as the Jetson Nano for on-edge model deployment.

All the logic for running on Jetson Nano is in the `read_csi.py`

This README will be updated with more details of the project in the future.
